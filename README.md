# prismcheck

## About

A simple terminal color checker adapted from [colortest](https://github.com/pablopunk/colortest)
and distributed with Deno.

## How it works

Embedded into the source code is a color display shell [script](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x329.html).
On your machine, it's simply piped into a Bash process and executed.

## Usage

### Run with [`land`](https://github.com/ije/land)

```console
land prismcheck
```
